The  project is a serbian word game made using python and is playable in the terminal by running the project.py file. This is a simple command-line game that tests your knowledge of Serbian vocabulary. The game randomly selects a word in Serbian, and you have to guess the correct translation in English.The program consists of a main function and 4 other subprograms/functions namely start_learning- Starts the game, generate_random_word-Generate a random word from the dictionary, get_translation- Get the translation of a word from the dictionary,get_options- Get a list of options, including the correct answer, for a given translation. The program randomly selects a word in Serbian, gets its translation, generates a list of options, including the correct answer, shuffles the options, and asks the user to select one. If the user's input is valid, the program checks if the user's guess matches the correct translation and updates the score and number of questions accordingly. The game continues until the user has answered 10 questions, and then displays the final score and a message based on the user's performance. The code also includes functions that generate a random word from the dictionary, get the translation of a word from the dictionary, and get a list of options, including the correct answer, for a given translation.
